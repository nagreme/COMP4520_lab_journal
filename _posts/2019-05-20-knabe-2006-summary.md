### Paper Summary - “Evolving Biological Clocks using Genetic Regulatory Networks” Knabe et al., 2006


The goal of Knabe et al. was to gain a better understanding of biological clocks by modelling them with a gene regulatory network (GRN) model. Their GRNs have a fixed number of genes that are either “on” (always producing unless inhibited) or “off” (requires activation to produce) by default and each gene can have one or more binding sites for both positive and negative regulation. Proteins matching these binding sites exactly can bind and affect the production of the gene’s protein. Genes are encoded as strings (alphabet: [0,1,2,3]) with coding characters (0 and 1) and delimiters (2 and 3). Some global variables/parameters are also encoded. Regulation is effect by first binding a portion of free proteins based on the global binding proportion parameter, and then protein concentrations are adjusted by saturation and decay parameters. The activation level of a gene is then calculated based on the combination of bound proteins and their concentrations. If this is a positive value the output protein is produced at a quantity corresponding to the activation value. In this model, environmental stimuli, which is varied periodically across generations to encourage learning of cyclical behaviour, is represented as changes in protein concentrations outside of the regulation mechanisms and the GRN’s output is based on the concentration of specific proteins.

The authors use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve a population of GRNs, each trial composed of 250 individuals and lasting 250 generations. The initial individuals are generated with one protein binding site per gene and random coding bits. Their selection strategy is a combination of weak elitism and tournament selection with replacement. The elitism part of their process involves ensuring that the most fit individual from the current generation gets included in the next generation. Then all other individuals are replaced by offspring generated using parents from a tournament selection: out of a random subset of 15, the two best individuals are chosen as parents. Since replacement is used, the two parents of an offspring could be the same individual.

Once the parents are selected, single-point crossover and mutation operators are applied with 0.9 and 0.01 probability respectively in that order. To prevent crossovers that would break genes in their encoding, Knabe et al. split the parent genomes into compartments per gene, which is possible because their model uses a constant number of genes. Crossovers happen within a randomly selected compartment at a random point inside the corresponding genes. To allow genome size variability, which the authors explain is important for evolvability, they add a gaussian distribution random variable, with a mean 0 and standard deviation of 4, as an offset so that the crossover may be unequal, resulting in one shorter and one longer child. In comparison, the mutation operator is simple: it applies a bit flip to all coding bits with stated probability.

The authors tested two different number of genes (5 and 9) as well as several combinations of environmental input function, perturbation to environmental signal, and desired output function. They obtained well adapted GRNs capable of producing oscillating outputs in all cases, and noted that higher internal complexity (9 instead of 5 genes) resulted in better performance and less dependence on external stimuli. Less dependence on the environment was also associated with experimental settings that included some irregularities or unreliableness in the input stimuli. Unsurprisingly, GRNs that did not depend as much on external input were also more robust to distortions in their input. Regardless of the conditions, the authors found that due to their unequal crossovers the average population genome size increased over time. The amount of junk, extra bits and delimiters that cannot be parsed, also increased over time but slower than the overall size, meaning that populations did accumulate functional coding information from the unequal crossovers. Knabe et al. conclude that GRNs are a useful model for biological clocks.

Important takeaway for us: it’s possible to make a crossover operator (albeit non-standard) for GRN models that has good performance.
